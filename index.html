            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I'm Thomas, 33 years old and starting a new carrier after 9 years in laser
                     industry</p>
                <p>I've grown up with a computer in my hands and working in a computer field
                 was obvious to me. As life went on,I did not pursue that path after all. </p>
                 <p>Now, I have the opportunity to fix that. I decided to start learning 
                    computer science
                     starting with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin project</a> </p> 
                 <p>Now that you know me, please come <a href="pages/glossary.html">inside</a> </p>
